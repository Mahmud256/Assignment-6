            <h1 class="font-bold">1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
            <p><span class="font-bold">var:</span> var is the oldest keyword and has the widest scope. Variables declared with var are function-scoped, which means they can be accessed from anywhere within the function they are declared in, and from any nested functions.</p>

            <p><span class="font-bold">let:</span> let is a newer keyword that was introduced in ES6. Variables declared with let are block-scoped, which means they can only be accessed from within the block they are declared in.</p>

            <p><span class="font-bold">const:</span> const is also a newer keyword that was introduced in ES6. Variables declared with const are constant variables, which means their value cannot be changed. Const variables are also block-scoped.
            </p>

            <h1 class="font-bold">2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
            <p><span class="font-bold">use cases of null:</span> Null is a concept in programming and database management that represents the absence of a value or the absence of a reference to an object. It's an essential concept in many programming languages and databases, and it has several use cases: Initializing Variables, Missing Data, Default Values, Database Records, Testing and Conditionals,  Testing and Conditionals, Database Joins.</p>

            <p><span class="font-bold">use cases of undefined:</span> In programming, "undefined" is a value typically associated with variables or properties that have been declared but have not been assigned a value. It can also indicate that a function does not explicitly return a value. The use cases of "undefined" are closely related to variable and function behavior, and they include: Variable Initialization, Function Return Value, Object Properties, Function Parameters, Array Elements, Callback Functions, JSON Parsing.</p>

            <h1 class="font-bold">3. What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
            <p><span class="font-bold">REST API:</span> A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for designing and interacting with web services. It is based on the principles of REST, which is an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST APIs are commonly used to enable communication and data exchange between different software systems over the internet.</p>
